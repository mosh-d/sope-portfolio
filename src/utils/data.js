    about:
      "I’m a highly creative UX designer with a strong background in art, animation, and front-end development. Deep understanding of UI/UX design concepts leads to a strong passion for designing user-centered solutions that are interactive, functional, accessible, and user-friendly. Proficient in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which can aid a smooth and efficient transition from design to development. I also bring a business lens to my work. With a Masters degree in Project Management, I understand how to balance stakeholder expectations with design and business requirements—navigating time, cost, and quality constraints to deliver real value. I’m passionate about Japanese culture. I enjoy Japanese fashion, TV shows, anime, and karate. I speak 5 languages: Design, Engineering, Business, English, and Japanese.",
